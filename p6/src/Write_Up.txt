Grid Encoding - 

	generate_successors:
		-This function takes into account two selection methods.
		-The first selection method was roulette-wheel selection. This first takes into account the sum of the fitness of the population. It then calculates the relative fitness.
			It then sums up the probability of each member of the population and if it is better than a random number between 0 and the max fitness, then it will be chosen.
		-The second selection method was tournament selection. We take an object from the beginning and the end and traverse to the middle. Each object is compared with each other.
			The one with a better fitness will be added.
		-This function then generates children according to the parents that were selected by each method.
		-We cross both parent1 to parent2 and parent2 to parent1 to ensure all possibilities and double our population.

	generate_children:
		-This function employs a multi-point crossover technique with the given x and y switched with other's y and x.
		-A multi-point crossover made the most sense, since the function loops through each x and y coordinate of the level, allowing change in mutiple positions.
		-It generates one child, from a combination of self and replacement items from other. 
		-There's a 10% chance for each item to be crossed over with other's items at the current coordinates.
		-If the item from other is a pipe or pipe top, the function does not perform a crossover.
	mutate:
		-This function replaces the current item at y and x if it is "unfit" and if the rate allows
		-Each item at a coordinate has a 33% chance of being mutated if it is a wall or pipe/pipe top or empty block.
		-An example of an "unfit" item would be a floating wall or floating pipe/pipe top or an empty block. 
		-The item that replaces the wall is randomly decided to be either an empty space or a breakable block.
		-The item that replaces the pipe/pipe top is randomly decided to either be a question mark block with a coin or one with a mushroom.
		-The item that replaces the empty block is randomly decided to either be a question mark block with a coin or just a coin.

Individual Encoding - 

	fitness:
		-This function is the same as the given calculate_fitness function. 
		-It is unchanged because we had somewhat more consistent results and since it is the default, we figured it would be a reliable structure.
	mutate:
		-This function enters the if statement, if the random chance falls below 10% and new_genome has a length greater than 0.
		-After a series of checks and if statments, it determines the type of item and calculates whether it should mutate it or not
		-If the random number generators approve a mutation (by making the if conditions true), then the x, y, width, and/or height are changed according to the type of item. 
			-For example, the x or height of the stairs is changed why of the hole, the width or x are changed.


Unfortunately, we were unable to test the Individual_DE encoding due to some bugs that we weren't able to solve.
